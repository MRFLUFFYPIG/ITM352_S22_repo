            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>OoohMami was founded on making beef jerky easier to eat. It was created to bring interesting and unique flavors to people. Most recently, its been streamlined to showcase and introduce Asian Flavors to people through beef jerky.

                Completely biased opinion, but crispy beef jerky is the best way to consume jerky. It brings the end of the dreaded “Beef Gum” you find with so many other big name brands.
                
                I hope you enjoy eating it as much as I enjoy creating them!</p>
